/**
 * GexTarget scoring math: pure component scorers that turn per-strike
 * gamma-exposure (GEX) features into a composite "target strike" signal.
 *
 * This is the v1 rebuild of the GEX magnet logic. It replaces the old
 * `gex-migration.ts` module with a spec-driven, multi-mode scoring
 * pipeline described in
 * `docs/superpowers/plans/gex-target-rebuild.md`, Appendix C.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Every function in this file is pure and synchronous. No React, no
 *   network, no database. The scorers are called from a `useMemo` on
 *   the frontend after the board-history hook delivers snapshots.
 * - Each scorer has a bounded output range (documented in its JSDoc)
 *   so the composite score in Appendix C.4 has a predictable envelope.
 * - Null-handling is explicit: a null horizon in `flowConfluence` is
 *   dropped and the remaining weights are renormalized, so early-session
 *   snapshots (no 20m / 60m history yet) still produce usable signal.
 *
 * See `src/__tests__/utils/gex-target.components.test.ts` for the
 * exhaustive test matrix (Appendix D of the plan doc).

 * The four delta horizons carry **three parallel representations**:

 *    directly lets the ML pipeline train thresholds on them without
